# GJatte
Single-cell RNAseq data visualization library (https://github.com/diegomscoelho/GJatte)

### Description

Create a library in R that will facilitate scRNAseq data sharing. Reprocessing all datasets and probably an unified databank with all single-cell RNAseq will have an unprecedented data cost. Metadata also is poorly shared and access to most of that datasets are limited. A tool that automatically unifies different datasets inputs and create a user-friendly tool would be a great achievement to single-cell data sharing.

### Main Goal

Shiny-based webtool to facilitate data sharing among single-cell datasets.

### Beta-examples:
